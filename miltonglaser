His work revolutionised the way Graphic Design was viewed and he is one of the most celebrated Graphic Designers in the US seen as an apotheosis of American design during his time.  Not only was Glaser nominated for the Lifetime Achievement award of the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum in 2004 and the Fulbright Association award in 2011 but he was also the first Graphic Design to receive the National Medal of Arts award in 2009 by Barack Obama.  He went to Manhattanâ€™s High School of Art and Music (Now known as Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music, Art and Performing Arts).  He graduated from the Cooper Union in 1951 and later graduated from The Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna via a Fulbright Scholarship.  </div>
